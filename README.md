# funscript-copilot

Currently this project only support Linux via [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html). In Addition you need to install [my Fork of OFS](https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/OFS) which supports Addition websocket functions.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to `$HOME/.local/share/OFS/OFS3_data/extensions`. Don't forget the git submodules (`git submodule update --init`).
2. Start my Fokr of OFS and use the new available Extension `funscript-copilot`.
